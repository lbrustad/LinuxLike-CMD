# LinuxLike CMD - by Lasse Brustad

Hey there! This is a small batch file project I wanted to develop for fun to make Windows Command Prompt look a bit more like a Linux Terminal!

Here you may read some info before you use it!

## About me

I'm a hobby web developer using both frontend and backend, but I know some other coding too!

## Usage

### No installation:

Download the file and double click it! It works as a standalone file without any other issues than the known problem that I'll try to fix!

### Installation:

I will create a batch file to automate it later, but before the automated install is developed, you may use `Registry Editor` manually!

1) Open the Windows menu and type in `regedit` and press enter
2) Navigate to `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`
3) Right click and choose new expandable string
4) Add the value as the path to LinuxLike.bat and save

## Bugs & problems

The only problem I know so far is that inputs using variables doesn't work! I have to fix it to prefer using this all the time by myself! If you know how to fix, I would give you the credits for helping if you tell me the solution!
